My primary research interest involves the mathematical investigation of machine learning techniques to create algorithms that, in some way, adapts to its users, or more generally learns from its environment. The approach is both theoretical and application oriented. A major objective is to ensure the proposed algorithms capture the real complexity of a problem and to study  their scalability towards real-world applications. 

During my PhD, I investigated \textit{reinforcement learning}  which is a field where an agent has to learn from its environment in order to maximise some measure of long-term performance. More precisely, the focus was on a class of algorithms called ``Classification-based Policy Iteration'' (CBPI) which are algorithms that learn directly the policies as output of a classifier. Thus they avoid, as in the standard RL techniques, to directly rely on  value function as the approximation of these is sometime poorer than the policy approximation. To improve the CBPI sample-efficiency, I proposed new hybrid approaches using both value function and policy approximations in the CBPI framework that leverage the benefits of both approaches (which led to two publications in ICML 2011 \& 2012 while a journal paper has been published in JMLR). Moreover, we applied our techniques in the game of Tetris, a domain where RL techniques had obtained poor results, and learned a controller removing on average 50.000.000 lines (the best in the literature, to the best of our knowledge which is reported in a paper in NIPS 2013).

I also investigated \textit{bandit problems}. Bandit problems are the core mathematical formulation for modelling of adaptive and sequential decision-making. My interest was to design algorithms that solve challenging combinatorial problems. A first step has been to tackle the case of parallel bandit problems (which led to two publications in NIPS 2011 \& 2012). As a post-doctorate, I am currently studying the extension  to more general and challenging combinatorial settings. 
Moreover, I also  made use of the bandit approach to prospose new solutions to industry problems during two of my internships. During my research internship  at Technicolor Labs, while trying to improve the questionnaire asked to elicit movie preferences of users for a recommendation website, a combinatorial learning problem arose. We designed a scalable bandit algorithms by using the submodular property that naturally arises in this problem (this led to a publication in NIPS 2013 \& AAAI 2014). During my master internship I proposed a combination of bandits techniques with linear programming to design an ad server software for the Orange Telecommunications company that takes into account limited budget constraint other various ad categories (the subsequent publication was awarded a best paper award in a French conference).  My research also involves more theoretical objectives. As a postodoctoral fellow,  I currently investigate the fundamental learning limits of the non-stochastic (adversarial) combinatorial bandit problem. The goal is to give a simple formulation of this bandit game that admits an exact minimax solution. Seen as a two-player game this problem is very closely connected to game theory that we are investigating (a subject also very relevant to this proposal).

%Through the experiences already described I developed my ability to work in a team environment. The international conferences, internships and summer schools I have been attending gave me the opportunity to learn and exchange with researchers from diverse horizons. In addition, teaching computer science (Algorithmic with Python \& Databases) for Master and Licence students keeps enriching my communication skills. I build up my programming skills through my curriculum in a telecommunication engineering school and later through the lectures and practical sections I gave. Moreover most of my projects have involved programming part which have made me comfortable with coding in Python and  C++.

%y long term career goal is to become a  researcher.  I wish to gain professional experience at an environment that will allow me to expand my knowledge and capabilities through collaborations with researchers who can mentor and inspire me. I am confident that the Lancaster University will provide me with such an environment and much more. It fits my willingness to  lead research that can find real applications, particularly in artificial intelligence for games or robotic purpose (as I already worked on the Tetris game. I believe that my background in Machine Learning will permit me to take on Lancaster University on designing powerful secutity program.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{\text{Research:}} \textit{\textbf{Reinforcement Learning is Finally Competitive:}} We proposed a new family of reinforcement learning methods based on ``Classification-based Policy Iteration'' algorithms. In addition to providing thorough theoretical analysis of these methods (C3,C5), we implemented the proposed algorithms and ran extensive experimental studies to analyse their performance using the game of Tetris as a benchmark (the experiments involved computing on a grid of computers). Our results show an unprecedented performance of reinforcement learning methods in Tetris, improving upon the state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, while these state-of-the-art techniques were based on black-box optimisation methods that require a large number of samples from the environment, our methods are able to learn Tetris strategies and achieve the same performance with 10 times less number of samples (C8).
\item \textit{\text{Industry:}} \textit{\textbf{Constrained Learning for Orange Ad Server:}} Orange, the leading company to provide telecommunication solutions in France, had made a contract with the research team SequeL in order to automate their online web-advertising services. My initial goal was to make a survey of the machine learning literature and find an appropriate solution to optimise their click-through rate revenues. This solution had to take into account specific new constraints on the limited and known number of display per ads. I proposed a new approach combining linear programming and bandit algorithms and validated its performance on synthetic data. The results received the best paper award at the French conference on Data Extraction and Knowledge Management (C2). Moreover, the project initiated an ongoing collaboration between SequeL and Orange.  
\item \textit{\text{Industry:}} \textit{\textbf{Adaptive Questionnaire Design at Technicolor Inc:}} 
During the course of my PhD, I participated in a 6-months R\&D internship program at Technicolor Inc.'s research lab. The primary goal of my project was to improve upon an online questionnaire which aimed to elicit users' movie preferences and generate a recommender system. I cast the program as an adaptive submodular maximisation problem. 
The novelty of my approach was to consider a completely realistic formulation of the problem where the users' preferences were unknown and to be actively learned in order to build the adaptive questionnaire.  
My efforts in this short period of time resulted in the publication of two peer-reviewed papers at prestigious international conferences in machine learning (C7, C9).
