\section{Excellence}
\label{sec:excellence}

\TODO{Convince the reader that this is state of the art, important, timely and relevant.  It needs to demonstrate quality and innovation.  There needs to be some detail on the methodological approach.  We need to give some specifics on complementary skills development (in particular leadership), and give clarity and specifics on how VG will reach independence.}

{\em
Please note that the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers promoting open recruitment and attractive working conditions are expected to be endorsed and applied by all beneficiaries in the Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions.
}
\input{Excellence-Quality.tex}



%Or say that the approach that do only rarely propose strong theoretical results (to the notable exception of Blum)
%like \cite{Marecki12PR} (which by the way use a theoretically not sound algorithm UCT) 
\subsection{Clarity and quality of transfer of knowledge/training for the development of the researcher in light of the research objectives}
\label{sec:transfer}

{\em Outline how a two way transfer of knowledge will occur between the researcher and the host institution, in view of their future development and past experience: (please see Section 5.2 of this Guide):
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain how the Experienced Researcher will gain new knowledge during the fellowship at the hosting organisation(s)
\item Outline the previously acquired knowledge and skills that the researcher will transfer to the host organisation
\end{itemize}
}

The overall trianing objective is to significantly develop Dr Gabillon's scientific, organisational, communication and technology transfer skills.  This will enable him to continue building his portfolio of outstanding research to attain a position of independence and gain recognition in the international research community.

The proposed project is primarily a research project, and the main training objectives are to enhance the fellow's scientific skills. Dr Gabillon is already an expert in the modern theory of bandits, including best arm identification, and reinforcement learning.  Therefore this project's main training objective for Dr Gabillon will be to develop his skills and knowledge in statistical learning methods and game theory.  The supervisor is an expert in both areas, and will of course assist the development of the Researcher.  Further expertise in Lancaster from whom the Researcher will learn includes the Statistical Learning group, in which the Researcher will be based, and the broader Statistics Research Group.

Considering also the research group in operations research within the Management School, Lancaster is the leading UK institution in bandit theory, with expertise in index policies (Glazebrook, Kirkbride, Jacko), Thompson sampling and contextual bandits (Grunewalder, Leslie) and application in medical trials (Vilar). Dr Gabillon will have ample opportunity to further develop his expertise in this area, and indeed brings expertise from a complementary aspect of online learning and decision-making in the design and analysis of algorithmic approaches to learning, especially with combinatorial bandit problems.   Dr Gabillon's expertise in best-arm identification will be of great interest to the Medical and Pharmaceutical Statistics research group.  He will present his research in this area to the research group and discuss possible applications in clinical trial design.  Furthermore his expertise in combinatorial bandits complements current industrially-funded research of the Supervisor.

In addition to his research skills, Dr Gabillon will learn from the host's world-leading expertise in developing industrially-inspired statistics.  Statistical researchers in Lancaster have constant exposure to external companies, through the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, and the Data Science Institute.  While embedded in this culture, Dr Gabillon will be given the opportunity to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Gain further experience of developing industry/academic partnerships by working with Profs.\ Leslie and Eckley and other staff in STOR-i and the Data Science Institute in technology transfer activities.
\item Develop public communication skills by presenting research results to varied audiences.
\item Participate in the organisation of workshops in Lancaster and at the Royal Statistical Society.
\item Receive training on preparing funding applications by co-authoring proposals for UK and EU funding agencies with Prof.\ Leslie and others.
\item Attend staff training workshops designed specifically for early-career researchers, and specifically the Research Development Programme, a structured development route for researchers, designed to promote impactful research and to support development beyond a disciplinary area.
\item Participate in teaching and research supervision at undergraduate and graduate level.  This will not be obligatory, but the fellow will be given the opportunity to benefit from peer observation, mentoring, and constructive criticism.
\end{enumerate}


The UK Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers is an agreement between funders and employers of research staff to improve the employment and support for researchers and research careers in UK higher education.  Lancaster University is fully committed to the Concordat to Support the Career Development of Researchers and has put in place an Action Plan to support the full implementation of the Concordat at Lancaster.  Furthermore, throughout the fellowship, Dr Gabillon will adhere to the ``European Charter for Researchers'', and the training objectives will be managed through a Personal Career Development Plan that Prof.\ Leslie and Dr Gabillon will write together.  This plan will be revised regularly throughout the fellowship to ensure that all objectives are met.  In addition, Dr Gabillon will have regular meetings with the host supervisor to discuss his research and to receive advice.


\subsection{Quality of the supervision and the hosting arrangements}
\label{sec:supervision}

{\em
Required sub-heading:
\subsubsection*{Qualifications and experience of the supervisor(s)}

Information regarding the supervisor(s) must include the level of experience on the research topic proposed and document its track record of work, including the main international collaborations. Information provided should include participation in projects, publications, patents and any other relevant results.
To avoid duplication, the role and profile of the supervisor(s) should only be listed in the "Capacity of the Participating Organisations" tables (see section 6 below). 

\subsubsection*{Hosting arrangements\footnote{The hosting arrangements refer to the integration of the Researcher to his new environment in the premises of the Host. It does not refer to the infrastructure of the Host as described in Criterion Implementation.}}
The text must show that the Experienced Researcher should be well integrated within the hosting organisation(s) in order that all parties gain the maximum knowledge and skills from the fellowship. The nature and the quality of the research group/environment as a whole should be outlined, together with the measures taken to integrate the researcher in the different areas of expertise, disciplines, and international networking opportunities that the host could offer.

For GF both phases should be described - for the outgoing phase, specify the practical arrangements in place to host a researcher coming from another country, and for the incoming phase specify the measures planned for the successful (re-)integration of the researcher.

Describe briefly how the host will contribute to the advancement of their career. In that context the following section of the European Charter for Researchers refers specifically to career development:
}
%\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}\paragraph{Career development}
%Employers and/or funders of researchers should draw up, preferably within the framework of their human resources management, a specific career development strategy for researchers at all stages of their career, regardless of their contractual situation, including for researchers on fixed-term contracts. It should include the availability of mentors involved in providing support and guidance for the personal and professional development of researchers, thus motivating them and contributing to reducing any insecurity in their professional future. All researchers should be made familiar with such provisions and arrangements.\end{minipage}}
%
%Therefore a Career Development Plan should not be included in the proposal, but it is part of implementing the project in line with the European Charter for Researchers.

\subsubsection*{Qualifications and experience of the supervisor(s)}

Prof.\ Leslie leads the Statistical Learning research group in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University, and Theme Lead for Foundations in Lancaster University's new Data Science Institute.  He is a world-leading researcher in statistical learning, Bayesian inference, decision-making and game theory, with 19 refereed articles in top journals of several different research fields, and collaborators from France, Singapore, USA and Australia.  His research on contextual bandit algorithms \cite{MayEtAl2012} is used by many of the world's largest companies to balance exploration and exploitation in real-time website optimisation.  He is expert in the mathematics of learning in games, \cite{LeslieCollins03,LeslieCollins05,LeslieCollins06,ChapmanEtAl2013,PerkinsLeslie2014} stochastic approximation, \cite{LeslieCollins03,PerkinsLeslie2012,PerkinsLeslie2014} and the mathematics of statistically-inspired reinforcement learning. \cite{LeslieCollins05,LarsenEtAl2010}  Prof.\ Leslie is the holder of a Google Faculty Award which funds a student to investigate multiple-action selection in bandits.  Prior to his relocation to Lancaster, he was a senior lecturer in the statistics group of the School of Mathematics, University of Bristol.  He continues to be co-director of the \pounds1.5m EPSRC-funded cross-disciplinary decision-making research group at the University of Bristol, and was on the management team of the \pounds5.5m ALADDIN project, a large strategic partnership between BAE Systems and EPSRC, involving researchers from Imperial College, Southampton, Oxford, Bristol and BAE Systems.

Prof.\ Leslie's mentoring approach is one of `guided freedom' in which the mentee takes responsibility for their own research, while regular discussions ensure that dead ends are avoided and promising openings are exploited.  In the 10 years since taking up a Faculty position, he has supervised 17 PhD students, 2 post-doctoral fellows, numerous MSc and undergraduate dissertations, and an undergraduate secondment from ENS Lyon.

\subsubsection*{Hosting arrangements}

Dr Gabillon will be embedded within the statistical learning group which is lead by Prof.\ Leslie.  This is a team of 5 academic staff and around 5 PhD students within the Department of Mathematics and Statistics.  The Researcher will participate in weekly group meetings and benefit from advice from the senior scientists in the group, including the Supervisor, on research direction and management, personal development, workshop organisation, teaching, and other aspects of academic life.  The group also has extremely strong links with both the Data Science Institute (www.lancaster.ac.uk/dsi/) and the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training (www.stor-i.lancs.ac.uk/), each of which have approximately weekly seminars.  These exciting initiatives will provide multiple further opportunities to develop informal mentoring relationships in addition to the formal process which takes place for all staff at Lancaster University; to ensure integration within these networks the Researcher will be introduced to the groupings of researchers, invited to deliver a seminar on his research, and will participate on project away days in which strong relationships are developed.



\subsection{Capacity of the researcher to reach and re-enforce a position of professional maturity in research}
\label{sec:maturity}

{\em
Applicants should demonstrate how their proposed research and personal experience can contribute to their professional development as an independent/mature researcher.

Please keep in mind that the fellowships will be awarded to the most talented researchers as shown by the proposed research and their track record (Curriculum Vitae, section 4), in relation to their level of experience.
}

Dr Gabillon's intention is to continue developing until he is able to build and lead a multi-disciplinary research group, developing innovative and impactful research in machine learning for decision-making, in collaboration with industry partners.  The initial stages of the researcher's career indicate that this is a realistic goal, with multiple high-quality publications in a short time frame, and already significant international research experience (see Section \ref{sec:cv}).  He has worked both as an academic researcher, and within a company \TODO{Which company, doing what?}, and the proposed research will broaden his research foundations significantly to allow further development as an independent researcher.  Working closely with Lancaster University's Data Science Institute, and STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, will not only develop a professional network of impact-aware academics, it will foster skills in the development of academia/industry partnerships.

Furthermore, Dr Gabillon will establish a 2-year Personal Career Development Plan which he will update regularly under the mentorship of Prof.\ Leslie, the project Supervisor.  The Fellow will have access to Lancaster's central training resources, which will be used to further develop skills in teaching, public engagement, research supervision and management, which will contribute greatly to a position of professional maturity.  Moreover, by participating in weekly seminars, group meetings, and informal gatherings, the Fellow will have the opportunity to receive valuable feedback about his career development from the experience scientists in the Statistics Research Group.  This research group is visited by dozens of internationally-leading scientists each year, which will provide further opportunities to develop a research network and reach a position of professional maturity.

\section{Impact}
\label{sec:impact}

\TODO{Demonstrate: worthwhile outreach, good communication strategy (are there existing connections that can be exploited?), adequate discussion of impact on researcher's career, indication of how outreach activities will be assessed, strategies for exploitation of outcomes.}

\subsection{Enhancing research- and innovation-related skills and working conditions to realise the potential of individuals and to provide new career perspectives}
\label{sec:enhancement}

{\em
Explain the expected impact of the planned research and training, and new competences acquired during the fellowship on the capacity to increase career prospects for the Experienced Researcher after this fellowship finishes.

Demonstrate also to what extent competences acquired during the fellowship, including any secondments will increase the impact of the researcher?s future activity on European society, including the science base and/or the economy
}

Dr Gabillon is already a leading researcher in the mathematics of bandit algorithms and reinforcement learning.  This fellowship provides a training oppotunity in two key additional research competences.  Firstly, the Researcher will develop an in depth knowledge of cutting edge statistical theory, and bring that to bear within bandit algorithms.  Training will be received from leading scientists in statistics and operations research at Lancaster University, and the many international visiting researchers who visit the department.   Secondly, the Supervisor is a leading expert on learning in games, as well as bandit algorithms, and will mentor the Researcher to bring ideas from bandits into the game theoretical scenarios of this research proposal.  This significant broadening of the researcher's skill set will give him an extremely solid foundation on which to build a future research career.

In addition to pure research opportunities, Dr Gabillon will work with Lancaster University's extremely effective mechanisms for industrial collaboration.  He will develop skills in how to manage the industry/academia relationship to ensure mutually beneficial outcomes.  This relationship-management will be a skill for academics in the future; Lancaster University, and particularly the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, is currently a world-leading institution in developing such relationships.  The Researcher will both be introduced to prospective industrial partners, and receive mentoring as he develops his own relationships.


\subsection{Effectiveness of the proposed measures for communication and results dissemination}

{\em
The new knowledge generated by the action should be used wherever possible to advance research, to foster innovation, and to promote the research profession to the public. Therefore develop following three points.
\begin{itemize}
\item Communication and public engagement strategy of the action
\item Dissemination of the research results
\item Exploitation of results and intellectual property rights
\end{itemize}
Concrete plans for the above must be included in the Gantt Chart (see point 3.1).
The following sections of the European Charter for Researchers refer specifically to public engagement and dissemination:

\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\paragraph{Public engagement}
Researchers should ensure that their research activities are made known to society at large in such a way that they can be understood by non-specialists, thereby improving the public's understanding of science. Direct engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand public interest in priorities for science and technology and also the public's concerns.
\paragraph{Dissemination, exploitation of results}
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are expected to take a lead in ensuring that research is fruitful and that results are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or both) whenever the opportunity arises.\end{minipage}}
}

%\TODO{Think about public engagement. I'm planning to set up a ``Data Science Network'' around Lancaster to help generate both enthusiasm and contacts within local companies.  Now might be a good time to write something more formally about it!}

With the launch of the Data Science Institute, Lancaster University will be inaugurating a ``Data Science Network'', bringing together academic data scientists with local companies in regular show and tell sessions.  The Researcher will be a regular participant at these events, enabling him to present aspects of his research to the local business community, develop an understanding of the business requirements for this kind of user, and build a network of industry contacts.  In addition, Lancaster University supports researchers to write for the Conversation, a news  service delivering articles directly from researchers to the public; the Researcher will make use of this support to produce expository articles explaining the benefits that adaptive data science approaches can deliver to society.  Finally, to ensure successful public engagement, Dr Gabillon will attend Lancaster University's ``The Engaging Researcher Course'', a one-day experiential training course to explore public engagement activities that researchers can get involved in.

The excellent and innovative research generated in this project will of course be published Open Access in the world's leading academic journals and conferences.  Prof.\ Leslie currently works with several companies, both large and small, and Dr Gabillon will be mentored to develop similar relationships.  We will discuss results directly with companies in Lancaster University's Knowledge Business Centre, an innovation hub providing a gateway for business/academic interaction which allows the transfer of expertise between Lancaster's academics, regional businesses and community partnerships through training and technology transfer activities.  A particularly successful mechanism deployed extensively at Lancaster is the industrially-sponsored MSc or PhD project, which allows the supervisor's research to be both developed and deployed directly within a company; the Researcher will be encouraged to join appropriate supervisory teams to help both disseminate the project's research and develop an industrial research network to enhance his future career.  The Research Support Office of Lancaster University has extensive experience of industrial engagement and will assist in the management of IP and any patents that may arise from the research.

\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\TODO{Show them: specific tasks and clearly-defined outputs/deliverables; host institution has capacity to support researcher; coherent workplan (including justification for the scheduling); metrics to assess progress; clear management structure (ie what is done beyond regular supervisor meetings); risk management and contingency plans; quality management procedures}

\subsection{Overall coherence and effectiveness of the work plan, including appropriateness of the allocation of tasks and resources}

{\em
Describe the different work packages. The proposal should be designed in such a way to achieve the desired impact. A Gantt Chart should be included in the text listing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Work Packages titles (for EF there should be at least 1 WP);
\item List of major deliverables;\footnote{A deliverable is a distinct output of the action, meaningful in terms of the action?s overall objectives and may be a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software, etc.}\footnote{Deliverable numbers ordered according to delivery dates. Please use the numbering convention <WP number>.<number of deliverable within that WP>. For example, deliverable 4.2 would be the second deliverable from work package 4.}
\item List of major milestones;\footnote{Milestones are control points in the action that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the action where, for example, the researcher must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.}
\item Secondments if applicable.
\end{itemize}
The schedule should be in terms of number of months elapsed from the start of the project.
}

\subsection{Appropriateness of the management structure and procedures, including quality management and risk management}

{\em
Develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project organisation and management structure, including the financial management strategy, as well as the progress monitoring mechanisms put in place;
\item Risks that might endanger reaching project objectives and the contingency plans to be put in place should risk occur.
\end{itemize}
}

The Research Support Office at Lancaster University has extensive experience of managing European project grants, and will be responsible for administering the project budget and the legal aspects.  The Fellow will be a member of the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and more specifically the Statistical Learning group lead by Prof.\ Leslie.  The Fellow will also be assigned a formal mentor under standard Lancaster University human resources procedures, who will be a second point of contact for the Researcher.  During the project, Dr Gabillon will be responsible for the research work, and will meet weekly with Prof.\ Leslie to discuss results, challenges and research strategies.  The Fellow will also be responsible for the management of the project; he will be supervised in this task through monthly management and mentoring meetings with the Supervisor, in which progress against the workplan and career development plan will be discussed.

\TODO{Discuss risk management.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Give a description of the main tasks and commitments of the beneficiary and partners (if applicable).
\item Describe the infrastructure, logistics, facilities offered in as far they are necessary for the good implementation of the action.
\end{itemize}
}

The Researcher will be hosted in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Lancaster University.  Prof.\ Leslie will provide the main mentorship and research supervision.  The Statistical Learning group, and the Statistics Research Group beyond that, will provide further immediate support to the Researcher.  The Department has extremely strong links with research groups in Operations Research in Lancaster University Management School, through the STOR-i Centre for Doctoral Training, and with Computer Science, through the Data Science Institute.  Therefore multiple researchers in cognate areas will contribute to the project with informal mentorship and research leadership, as well as providing an environment with multiple relevant research seminars.  In terms of physical resources, the Department will provide high quality office space and standard IT facilities to allow the researcher to carry out the project.

\subsection{Competences, experience and complementarity of the participating organisations and institutional commitment}
\label{sec:competences}


{\em
The active contribution of the beneficiary to the research and training activities should be described. For GF also the role of partner organisations in Third Countries for the outgoing phase should appear. Additionally a letter of commitment shall also be provided in Section 7 (included within the PDF file of part B, but outside the page limit) for the partner organisations in Third Countries.
NB: Each participant is described in Section 5. This specific information should not be repeated here.
}

The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Lancaster University was ranked fifth equal in the United Kingdom in the most recent Research Excellence Framework assessment.  The Department has a thriving research environment, with 50 faculty, 11 post-doctoral fellows, and 72 PhD students.  The Department has numerous government- and industry-funded research projects, many of which relate to industrially-motivated statistics and operations research and are related to the currently-proposed project.  The skill set of the Researcher complements that of the Beneficiary by providing expertise in current algorithmic approaches to bandit algorithms and reinforcement learning.  The host institution in return provides expertise in statistical methodology appropriate to online inference, and game theoretical learning, and a strong track-record of working with industry to ensure the fundamental research is relevant and generates impact.

\newpage
\section{CV of the Experienced Researcher}
\label{sec:cv}

This section should be limited to maximum 5 pages and should include the standard academic and research record. Any research career gaps and/or unconventional paths should be clearly explained so that this can be fairly assessed by the independent evaluators.
The Experienced Researchers must provide a list of achievements reflecting their track, and this may include, if applicable:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Publications in major international peer-reviewed multi-disciplinary scientific journals and/or in the leading international peer-reviewed journals, peer-reviewed conference proceedings and/or monographs of their respective research fields, indicating also the number of citations (excluding self-citations) they have attracted.
\item Granted patent(s).
\item Research monographs, chapters in collective volumes and any translations thereof.
\item Invited presentations to peer-reviewed, internationally established conferences and/or international advanced schools.

  \multicolumn{2}{l}{\textbf{Beneficiary: Lancaster University}} \\\midrule
\textbf{General Description} & Lancaster University is a top ten UK university.  The Department of Mathematics and Statistics, within the Faculty
of Science and Technology, hosts one of the largest and strongest statistics research groups in the
UK comprising 25 academic staff, 10 research associates and around 50 FTE research students. In the 2014
Research Excellence Framework assessment, the Mathematical Sciences at Lancaster were ranked fifth overall and third in
terms of the impact of research.  Research is supported by grants from the UK Research Councils, the European Commission, and industrial sponsors. The statistics research group is also a fundamental partner in Lancaster's new Data Science Institute, which aims to act as a catalyst for Data Science, providing an end-to-end interdisciplinary research capability --- from infrastructure and fundamentals through to globally relevant problem domains and the social, legal and ethical issues raised by the use of Data Science. 

\\\midrule
\textbf{Role and Commitment of key persons (supervisor)} &
Prof.\ David Leslie, PhD in Mathematics (University of Bristol, 2003).  17 PhD students and 2 post-doctoral fellows supervised. 5\% FTE time commitment to the project throughout the 24 month duration.
\\\midrule
\textbf{Key Research Facilities, Infrastructure and Equipment} &
The Department of Mathematics and Statistics is housed in dedicated space at Lancaster University.  The researcher will be provided with office space and basic equipment within the Department. \TODO{Computing facilities?}


\\\midrule
\textbf{Independent research premises?} & Yes

\\\midrule
\textbf{Previous Involvement in Research and Training Programmes} &
Between 2001 and 2005 the department held the Marie Curie Training Site status for its PhD programme. The Postgraduate Statistics Center (PSC) was founded in 2005 as the only Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning focussing on postgraduate statistics in the UK. The PSC is still operative and runs three Masters degrees (Statistics, Quantitative Methods, and Quantitative Finance) and coordinates the PhD programme in statistics.


\\\midrule
\textbf{Current involvement in Research and Training Programmes} &
Together with the Management School, the Department hosts and runs STOR-i, a
multi-million pound EPSRC-funded Centre for Doctoral Training in
Statistics and Operational Research in partnership with industry.  The
Centre was established in 2010 and funds 12 PhD students per year.  The department is also a key player in the Academy for Phd Training in Statistics, a collaboration between major UK statistics research groups to organise courses for first-year PhD students in statistics and applied probability nationally.  The group hosts one node of a multi-institution Programme Grant on Intractable Likelihood, and received industrial funding from companies including Shell, BT, Google and Unilever \TODO{Other big grants?}. The
Department's Medical and Pharmaceutical Statistics Research Unit
works closely with the pharmaceutical
industry and public sector research institutes to develop novel
statistical methods for the design and analysis of clinical trials. It
leads the EU-funded research training network IDEAS (www.ideas-itn.eu) and
is an integral part of the Medical Research Council funded North-West Hub for Trials
Methodology Research.
