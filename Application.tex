\section{Excellence}
\label{sec:excellence}

Please note that the principles of the European Charter for Researchers and Code of Conduct for the Recruitment of Researchers promoting open recruitment and attractive working conditions are expected to be endorsed and applied by all beneficiaries in the Marie Sklodowska-Curie actions.

\subsection{Quality, innovative aspects and credibility of the research (including inter/multidisciplinary aspects)}
\label{sec:quality}

You should develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Introduction, state-of-the-art, objectives and overview of the action
\item Research methodology and approach: highlight the type of research and innovation activities proposed
\item Originality and innovative aspects of the research programme: explain the contribution that the project is expected to make to advancements within the project field. Describe any novel concepts, approaches or methods that will be employed.
\end{itemize}
Explain how the high-quality, novel research is the most likely to open up the best career possibilities for the Experienced Researcher and new collaboration opportunities for the host organisation(s).

\subsection{Clarity and quality of transfer of knowledge/training for the development of the researcher in light of the research objectives}
\label{sec:transfer}

Outline how a two way transfer of knowledge will occur between the researcher and the host institution, in view of their future development and past experience: (please see Section 5.2 of this Guide):
\begin{itemize}
\item Explain how the Experienced Researcher will gain new knowledge during the fellowship at the hosting organisation(s)
\item Outline the previously acquired knowledge and skills that the researcher will transfer to the host organisation
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Quality of the supervision and the hosting arrangements}
\label{sec:supervision}

Required sub-heading:
\subsubsection*{Qualifications and experience of the supervisor(s)}

Information regarding the supervisor(s) must include the level of experience on the research topic proposed and document its track record of work, including the main international collaborations. Information provided should include participation in projects, publications, patents and any other relevant results.
To avoid duplication, the role and profile of the supervisor(s) should only be listed in the "Capacity of the Participating Organisations" tables (see section 6 below). 

\subsubsection*{Hosting arrangements\footnote{The hosting arrangements refer to the integration of the Researcher to his new environment in the premises of the Host. It does not refer to the infrastructure of the Host as described in Criterion Implementation.}}
The text must show that the Experienced Researcher should be well integrated within the hosting organisation(s) in order that all parties gain the maximum knowledge and skills from the fellowship. The nature and the quality of the research group/environment as a whole should be outlined, together with the measures taken to integrate the researcher in the different areas of expertise, disciplines, and international networking opportunities that the host could offer.

For GF both phases should be described - for the outgoing phase, specify the practical arrangements in place to host a researcher coming from another country, and for the incoming phase specify the measures planned for the successful (re-)integration of the researcher.

Describe briefly how the host will contribute to the advancement of their career. In that context the following section of the European Charter for Researchers refers specifically to career development:

\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}\paragraph{Career development}
Employers and/or funders of researchers should draw up, preferably within the framework of their human resources management, a specific career development strategy for researchers at all stages of their career, regardless of their contractual situation, including for researchers on fixed-term contracts. It should include the availability of mentors involved in providing support and guidance for the personal and professional development of researchers, thus motivating them and contributing to reducing any insecurity in their professional future. All researchers should be made familiar with such provisions and arrangements.\end{minipage}}

Therefore a Career Development Plan should not be included in the proposal, but it is part of implementing the project in line with the European Charter for Researchers.

\subsection{Capacity of the researcher to reach and re-enforce a position of professional maturity in research}
\label{sec:maturity}

Applicants should demonstrate how their proposed research and personal experience can contribute to their professional development as an independent/mature researcher.

Please keep in mind that the fellowships will be awarded to the most talented researchers as shown by the proposed research and their track record (Curriculum Vitae, section 4), in relation to their level of experience.

\section{Impact}
\label{sec:impact}

\subsection{Enhancing research- and innovation-related skills and working conditions to realise the potential of individuals and to provide new career perspectives}
\label{sec:enhancement}

IExplain the expected impact of the planned research and training, and new competences acquired during the fellowship on the capacity to increase career prospects for the Experienced Researcher after this fellowship finishes.

Demonstrate also to what extent competences acquired during the fellowship, including any secondments will increase the impact of the researcher?s future activity on European society, including the science base and/or the economy

\subsection{Effectiveness of the proposed measures for communication and results dissemination}


The new knowledge generated by the action should be used wherever possible to advance research, to foster innovation, and to promote the research profession to the public. Therefore develop following three points.
\begin{itemize}
\item Communication and public engagement strategy of the action
\item Dissemination of the research results
\item Exploitation of results and intellectual property rights
\end{itemize}
Concrete plans for the above must be included in the Gantt Chart (see point 3.1).
The following sections of the European Charter for Researchers refer specifically to public engagement and dissemination:
?????
?
\fbox{\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\paragraph{Public engagement}
Researchers should ensure that their research activities are made known to society at large in such a way that they can be understood by non-specialists, thereby improving the public's understanding of science. Direct engagement with the public will help researchers to better understand public interest in priorities for science and technology and also the public's concerns.
\paragraph{Dissemination, exploitation of results}
All researchers should ensure, in compliance with their contractual arrangements, that the results of their research are disseminated and exploited, e.g. communicated, transferred into other research settings or, if appropriate, commercialised. Senior researchers, in particular, are expected to take a lead in ensuring that research is fruitful and that results are either exploited commercially or made accessible to the public (or both) whenever the opportunity arises.\end{minipage}}


\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

\subsection{Overall coherence and effectiveness of the work plan, including appropriateness of the allocation of tasks and resources}
Describe the different work packages. The proposal should be designed in such a way to achieve the desired impact. A Gantt Chart should be included in the text listing the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Work Packages titles (for EF there should be at least 1 WP);
\item List of major deliverables;\footnote{A deliverable is a distinct output of the action, meaningful in terms of the action?s overall objectives and may be a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software, etc.}\footnote{Deliverable numbers ordered according to delivery dates. Please use the numbering convention <WP number>.<number of deliverable within that WP>. For example, deliverable 4.2 would be the second deliverable from work package 4.}
\item List of major milestones;\footnote{Milestones are control points in the action that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the action where, for example, the researcher must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.}
\item Secondments if applicable.
\end{itemize}
The schedule should be in terms of number of months elapsed from the start of the project.


\subsection{Appropriateness of the management structure and procedures, including quality management and risk management}

Develop your proposal according to the following lines:
\begin{itemize}
\item Project organisation and management structure, including the financial management strategy, as well as the progress monitoring mechanisms put in place;
\item Risks that might endanger reaching project objectives and the contingency plans to be put in place should risk occur.
\end{itemize}
