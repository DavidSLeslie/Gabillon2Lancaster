Professional maturity for Dr Gabillon consists of leading a dynamic research group actively working on mathematical problems at the interface of game theory and online learning, with strong impact in real-world applications. In a short period of time, Dr Gabillon has already developed broad expertise in the domain, with a strong publication record in both theory and applications. Indeed, a significant result of his PhD thesis is in bringing classical reinforcement learning algorithms closer to daily life.
% Dr Gabillon has also demonstrated strong ability to acquire new knowledge  and become highly productive in a short period of time
%Moreover, aside from providing theoretical guarantees for his proposed methods, this entailed spending a significant amount of time single-handedly managing extensive parallel-computing experiments over a grid of computers, a task for which he had no prior knowledge. 

During  a 6-months internship at a major US R\&D lab (Technicolor Research Laboratory, Palo Alto), Dr Gabillon developed collaborations with a team of industrial researchers. He quickly became productive and the internship produced two peer-reviewed papers at prestigious international conferences. He also obtained valuable knowledge about industrial research and its interaction with academia. This has given him a crucial understanding of the pathways to impact and how to establish industrial collaborations.

During the fellowship, Dr Gabillon will be closely mentored by Prof.\ Leslie at Lancaster University, and will have access to the university's research resources. He will thus further develop his research and supervision skills, which will greatly contribute to achieving professional maturity.% Dr Gabillon will also have the unique opportunity to establish inter-disciplinary collaborations through the STOR-i program, a quality research training interface between statistics and industry.
